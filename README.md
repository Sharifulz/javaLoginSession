# javaLoginSession

I have made this small project using mainly bootstrap card and modal.
used the log in form inside the modal to pop and which gives a better look. 

Validate the form with java servlet, control the user login session which means you can not log in by url after a log out from the session.

I use sweetalert plug ins to show beautiful alert box. 

the starting page of the project is login.jsp
